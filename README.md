# To-Do List Application

A simple and interactive To-Do List app that allows users to add, prioritize, and organize their tasks. The app uses HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to manage and display tasks and notes, making it easy for users to track their to-do lists efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Allows users to input tasks with high, medium, or low priority.
- **Categorize Tasks**: Tasks are displayed under three categories: All Tasks, Pending Tasks, and Completed Tasks.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Clicking on a task toggles its completion state, marking it as done.
- **Add Notes**: Users can add notes, with a limit of 10 notes displayed at a time. The oldest note is removed when the limit is reached.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be user-friendly with a stylish interface.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout using custom styles.
- **TypeScript**: Logic to manage tasks and notes.
